1. Update `docs/` when adding features that affect:
   - Key bindings → `docs/key-bindings.md`
   - Language support → `docs/supported-languages.md`
   - External tools → `docs/external-tools.md`
2. Keep README.md concise; detailed info goes in `docs/`
3. Maintain both English (`README.md`) and Korean (`README.ko.md`) versions
