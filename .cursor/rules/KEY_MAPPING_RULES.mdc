description: Guidelines for adding key mappings in Neovim. Always enforced.
alwaysApply: true

1. All custom mappings go in `lua/config/keymaps.lua`
2. Use `<leader>` prefix for custom mappings
3. Always include `desc` for which-key integration
4. Group related mappings under a common prefix:
   - `<leader>f` - Telescope/find
   - `<leader>g` - Git
   - `<leader>b` - Buffer
   - `<leader>t` - Terminal
   - `<leader>x` - Trouble/diagnostics
   - `<leader>a` - AI/Claude
   - `<leader>d` - Diagnostics
